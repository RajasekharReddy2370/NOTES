RFID [Radio Frequency Identification] zebra fx9600
it involves Application -> RFID Reader -> Antena -> RFID Tag


PROCESS FLOW : 
 When power on the RFID reader send signals to Antena The Antena emits Radio Waves
            when the radio waves hit the RFID tag the RFID tag sends Data to RFID reader then the decode and send data to Application

The data Transfring is 3 types
Through Lan -    LLRP     Protocol
        server - http
        cloud -  MQTT

RFID Reader
Antena for emitting radio waves the range is upto 30 feet 800 to 900 Mhz
[  3 to 500 Khz upto 3 feet
   30 to 300 Mhz upto 6 feet
  800 to 900 Mhz  upto 25 to 30 feet
  2.45 Ghz more than 100 feet ]

RFID Tag
        The RFID tag stores the information
        2 types of RFID Tags [Active, Passive]
        Active => which requires battey more cost upto more than 1000 feet communication { in Vehicles tracking }
        Passive => no battery cheaper less communication in warehouses { in Fasttag tollgate payments }
  Parts
        1. Antena       -> receiving Signals and sending signals
        2. Microchip    -> stores the information or data every tag has its uniqueID EPC number Electronic Product Code
        3. Substrate    -> the substrate joins and holds the Antena and Microchip

when the tag Antena receives the radio waves from the antena the current is generated in the chip and the microchip sends the information to antena -> Readert

connect the cable to the devices
open laptop
9989
in Desktop click RFID
connect the near by device
How to know whether it is connected or not(Green light will on if it is connected in RFID)
in Desktop also you would see connected
                                           
then click on the ip addredss of RFID starting with 16....

password is change
                                           
in LLRP connections   disconnect it
                                           
open the python RFID
Activate the environment ./venv/calls/Scripts/activate this will activate the environment
                                           
cd Rfid(Projectfolder NAME)
                                           
daphne -p 8001 RfidScanner.asgi:application

open the vscode                                           
npm start
                                           
it will open development server 
open the server
click the startbutton
it establishes the connection between frontend and backend 
and it also establishes the connection between the RFID

The RFID continuously pushes the data from the barcodes to the backend the backend pushes the data to frontend
tag list it will show the unique tags
tag count or tag scan it will show how many times the tags are scanned
to disconnect
open the python add another terminal
remove the first terminal

open vs code cntrl+c 

there are 4 blocks in the tag   
                                           
EPC NO
it is different for each tag 
this block contains the information about the product
